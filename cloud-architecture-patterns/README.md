# Cloud Architecture Patterns

## Overview

Cloud architecture patterns are design principles and templates for building scalable, resilient, and cost-effective applications in cloud environments. They leverage cloud-native services and best practices to optimize for elasticity, security, and performance.

## Detailed Explanation

### Core Cloud Patterns

- **Microservices Architecture**: Decompose applications into small, independent services
- **Serverless Computing**: Run code without managing servers (FaaS)
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: React to events asynchronously
- **Multi-Cloud Deployment**: Distribute across multiple cloud providers
- **Hybrid Cloud**: Combine public and private clouds

### Infrastructure Patterns

- **Auto-Scaling**: Automatically adjust resources based on demand
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute traffic across instances
- **Immutable Infrastructure**: Treat servers as disposable
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Manage infrastructure with code

### Data Patterns

- **Data Lake**: Centralized repository for structured/unstructured data
- **CQRS**: Separate read and write models
- **Event Sourcing**: Store state as sequence of events

### Security Patterns

- **Zero Trust**: Never trust, always verify
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers
- **Identity Federation**: Centralized identity management

## Real-world Examples & Use Cases

- **Netflix**: Uses microservices on AWS with auto-scaling and chaos engineering
- **Airbnb**: Employs serverless functions for booking workflows
- **Spotify**: Uses event-driven architecture for music recommendations
- **Capital One**: Implements multi-cloud for regulatory compliance

## Code Examples

### AWS Lambda Serverless Function

```javascript
exports.handler = async (event) => {
    console.log('Event:', JSON.stringify(event));
    return {
        statusCode: 200,
        body: JSON.stringify('Hello from Lambda!')
    };
};
```

### Terraform Infrastructure as Code

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  ami           = "ami-12345678"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  tags = {
    Name = "WebServer"
  }
}
```
