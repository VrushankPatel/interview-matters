## Detailed Explanation

**Impact**: Loses interviewer attention and demonstrates poor communication.
**Solution**: Use STAR method, keep answers concise (1-2 minutes).

### 4. Focusing on Salary Too Early

**Impact**: Questions technical competence.
**Solution**: Practice regularly, explain thinking process.

### 8. Overconfidence or Undervaluing
**Mistake**: Being arrogant or underselling achievements.
**Impact**: Creates poor impression either way.
**Solution**: Be confident but humble, quantify achievements.

## Real-world Examples & Use Cases

### The Rambling Candidate
A candidate gives a 10-minute response to "Tell me about yourself," losing the interviewer's attention and appearing unprepared.

### The Negative Nancy
When asked about leaving a previous job, a candidate complains about management, making interviewers question their fit.

### The Silent Type
At the end of the interview, when asked "Do you have any questions?", the candidate says "No," appearing disinterested.

## Code Examples

Example of a simple checklist script to avoid common mistakes:

```python
def interview_checklist():
    checklist = {
        "Researched company": False,
        "Prepared STAR stories": False,
        "Practiced coding problems": False,
        "Prepared questions for interviewer": False,
        "Tested technical setup": False,
        "Dressed appropriately": False,
        "Arrived early": False
    }
    
    print("Pre-Interview Checklist:")
    for item, status in checklist.items():
        status_icon = "✓" if status else "✗"
        print(f"{status_icon} {item}")
    
    completed = sum(checklist.values())
    total = len(checklist)
    print(f"\nCompleted: {completed}/{total}")
    
    if completed < total:
        print("Don't forget to complete the remaining items!")

# Usage

```
