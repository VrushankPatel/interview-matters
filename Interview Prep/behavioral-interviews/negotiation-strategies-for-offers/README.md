## Overview

Negotiating job offers involves discussing salary, benefits, and terms to achieve a mutually beneficial agreement. Preparation and confidence are key to successful outcomes.

## Detailed Explanation

Strategies:
- Research market rates using sites like Levels.fyi or Glassdoor
- Know your worth based on experience and location
- Prepare multiple offers for leverage
- Focus on total compensation (salary, bonuses, equity, benefits)
- Practice responses and be prepared to walk away

Common negotiation points: base salary, signing bonus, equity, vacation time, remote work.

## Real-world Examples & Use Cases

### Example 1: Salary Negotiation
**Scenario:** Offer of $120k base.

**Response:** "Based on my research and experience, I'm targeting $140k. Can we discuss adjusting the base or adding a signing bonus?"

### Example 2: Benefits Negotiation
**Request:** Additional PTO or remote work flexibility.

**Approach:** "I'd like to discuss work-life balance. Could we increase PTO to 25 days or allow full remote work?"

### Use Cases
- Entry-level positions: Focus on growth opportunities
- Senior roles: Emphasize equity and bonuses
- Counteroffers from current employer
