# Overview

Monitoring and logging are essential practices in software engineering for ensuring system reliability, performance, and debugging. Monitoring involves collecting metrics and health data, while logging captures events and messages for analysis.

# Detailed Explanation

Monitoring tracks system performance, availability, and health through metrics like CPU usage, memory, response times. Logging records events, errors, and user actions for troubleshooting.

## Key Concepts

- **Metrics**: Quantitative data (e.g., counters, gauges)
- **Logs**: Qualitative data (e.g., error messages)
- **Tracing**: Following request paths

# Real-world Examples & Use Cases

- E-commerce site monitoring for high traffic periods
- Logging user authentication failures for security audits

# Code Examples

```java
// Example logging with SLF4J
import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;

public class Example {
    private static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(Example.class);

    public void doSomething() {
        logger.info("Starting operation");
        try {
            // Simulate operation
            Thread.sleep(100);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            logger.error("Error occurred", e);
        }
    }
}
```
