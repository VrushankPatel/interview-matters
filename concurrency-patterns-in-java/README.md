# Concurrency Patterns in Java

## Overview

Concurrency patterns in Java provide reusable solutions for common problems in multithreaded programming, such as synchronization, communication, and resource sharing between threads.

## Detailed Explanation

These patterns help manage shared state, avoid race conditions, and improve performance in concurrent applications.

### Common Patterns

- **Producer-Consumer**: Decouples producers and consumers using a shared buffer.
- **Reader-Writer**: Allows multiple readers or single writer access to shared resources.
- **Thread Pool**: Reuses threads to execute tasks efficiently.
- **Barrier**: Synchronizes multiple threads to reach a common point.

## Real-world Examples & Use Cases

1. **Web Servers**: Handling multiple client requests concurrently.
2. **Data Processing**: Parallel processing of large datasets.
3. **GUI Applications**: Updating UI without blocking the main thread.

## Code Examples

### Producer-Consumer with BlockingQueue

```java
import java.util.concurrent.BlockingQueue;
import java.util.concurrent.LinkedBlockingQueue;

public class ProducerConsumer {
    private static final BlockingQueue<Integer> queue = new LinkedBlockingQueue<>(10);

    static class Producer implements Runnable {
        public void run() {
            try {
                for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
                    queue.put(i);
                    System.out.println("Produced: " + i);
                }
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
            }
        }
    }

    static class Consumer implements Runnable {
        public void run() {
            try {
                while (true) {
                    int item = queue.take();
                    System.out.println("Consumed: " + item);
                }
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### ReadWriteLock Example

```java
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReadWriteLock;
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantReadWriteLock;

public class ReadWriteExample {
    private final ReadWriteLock lock = new ReentrantReadWriteLock();
    private int value = 0;

    public int read() {
        lock.readLock().lock();
        try {
            return value;
        } finally {
            lock.readLock().unlock();
        }
    }

    public void write(int newValue) {
        lock.writeLock().lock();
        try {
            value = newValue;
        } finally {
            lock.writeLock().unlock();
        }
    }
}
```

## Common Pitfalls & Edge Cases

- **Deadlocks**: Circular waiting for resources.
- **Race Conditions**: Unpredictable results from concurrent access.
- **Starvation**: Threads unable to proceed due to resource contention.
