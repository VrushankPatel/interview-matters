# JVM Internals & Class Loading

## Overview

The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is the runtime environment for Java applications. Class loading is the process by which the JVM loads class files into memory. Understanding JVM internals and class loading is crucial for performance tuning and debugging.

## Detailed Explanation

### JVM Architecture

The JVM consists of:

- Class Loader Subsystem

- Runtime Data Areas

- Execution Engine

- Native Method Interface

### Class Loading Process

1. Loading: Finding and importing the binary data for a type.

2. Linking: Performing verification, preparation, and resolution.

3. Initialization: Executing static initializers and initializing static fields.

### Class Loaders

- Bootstrap Class Loader: Loads core Java classes.

- Extension Class Loader: Loads classes from extension directories.

- System/Application Class Loader: Loads classes from the application classpath.

### Runtime Data Areas

- Method Area: Stores class-level data.

- Heap: Stores objects.

- Stack: Stores method calls and local variables.

- PC Register: Holds the address of the current instruction.

- Native Method Stack: For native methods.

## Real-world Examples & Use Cases

- Custom class loaders for dynamic loading of plugins.

- Understanding OutOfMemoryError in heap or permgen.

- Performance tuning by monitoring JVM memory usage.

## Code Examples

### Custom Class Loader

```java
public class CustomClassLoader extends ClassLoader {
    @Override
    public Class<?> findClass(String name) throws ClassNotFoundException {
        byte[] b = loadClassFromFile(name);
        return defineClass(name, b, 0, b.length);
    }

    private byte[] loadClassFromFile(String fileName) {
        // Implementation to load class bytes from file
        return new byte[0];
    }
}
```

### Monitoring JVM

```java
public class JVMMemoryMonitor {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Runtime runtime = Runtime.getRuntime();
        long totalMemory = runtime.totalMemory();
        long freeMemory = runtime.freeMemory();
        long usedMemory = totalMemory - freeMemory;

        System.out.println("Total Memory: " + totalMemory / 1024 / 1024 + " MB");
        System.out.println("Free Memory: " + freeMemory / 1024 / 1024 + " MB");
        System.out.println("Used Memory: " + usedMemory / 1024 / 1024 + " MB");
    }
}
```
