## Overview

System design interviews evaluate a candidate's ability to design scalable, reliable systems. They test architectural knowledge, trade-off analysis, and problem-solving for large-scale applications.

## Detailed Explanation

In system design interviews, candidates are asked to design systems like URL shorteners, social networks, or e-commerce platforms. Key areas include scalability, availability, consistency, and performance. Interviewers look for understanding of distributed systems concepts, databases, caching, and load balancing.

Preparation involves:
- Studying common design patterns
- Practicing with real-world examples
- Understanding trade-offs (e.g., CAP theorem)
- Communicating design decisions clearly

## STAR Summary

For system design, adapt STAR to technical scenarios:
- Situation: The problem or requirement.
- Task: Design goals and constraints.
- Action: Proposed architecture and components.
- Result: Benefits, trade-offs, and metrics.

## Real-world Examples & Use Cases

### Example 1: Designing a URL Shortener
- **Requirements:** Handle millions of URLs, ensure uniqueness, provide analytics.
- **Design:** Use hash functions for shortening, database for storage, caching for performance.
- **Components:** API gateway, load balancer, Redis cache, relational DB.

### Example 2: Scaling a Chat Application
- **Challenges:** Real-time messaging, user presence, message persistence.
- **Solution:** WebSockets for real-time, message queues for reliability, sharding for scalability.

### Use Cases
- Designing microservices architectures
- Handling high-traffic scenarios
- Ensuring fault tolerance and security

## Code Examples

N/A - Focus on high-level design rather than implementation.
