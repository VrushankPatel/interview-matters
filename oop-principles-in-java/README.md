# OOP Principles in Java

## Overview

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. Java is fundamentally an object-oriented language, implementing OOP concepts through classes and objects. The four main principles of OOP are Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction. These principles help in creating modular, reusable, and maintainable code.

## Detailed Explanation

### Encapsulation
Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (behaviors) that operate on the data into a single unit called a class. It restricts direct access to some of an object's components, which is achieved using access modifiers like private, protected, and public.

**Benefits:**
- Data hiding and protection
- Increased security
- Easier maintenance

### Inheritance
Inheritance allows a class (subclass) to inherit properties and methods from another class (superclass). It promotes code reusability and establishes a relationship between classes.

**Types of Inheritance in Java:**
- Single inheritance
- Multilevel inheritance
- Hierarchical inheritance
- Multiple inheritance (through interfaces)

### Polymorphism
Polymorphism means "many forms" and allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class. It enables a single interface to represent different underlying forms (data types).

**Types:**
- Compile-time polymorphism (method overloading)
- Runtime polymorphism (method overriding)

### Abstraction
Abstraction is the process of hiding complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object. In Java, abstraction is achieved through abstract classes and interfaces.

**Key Points:**
- Abstract classes can have abstract and concrete methods
- Interfaces define contracts that implementing classes must follow
- Helps in reducing complexity and increasing efficiency

## Real-world Examples & Use Cases

1. **Banking System**: Using encapsulation to protect account balances, inheritance for different account types (savings, checking), polymorphism for interest calculation methods.
2. **Vehicle Management System**: Abstraction for a generic Vehicle class, inheritance for Car, Truck, Motorcycle subclasses.
3. **Employee Management**: Polymorphism for calculating salaries for different employee types (full-time, part-time, contractor).
4. **Shape Drawing Application**: Abstraction for Shape interface, concrete implementations for Circle, Rectangle, Triangle with polymorphic draw() methods.
5. **E-commerce Platform**: Encapsulation for Product classes, inheritance for different product categories.

## Code Examples

### Encapsulation Example
```java
public class BankAccount {
    private String accountNumber;
    private double balance;
    
    public BankAccount(String accountNumber, double initialBalance) {
        this.accountNumber = accountNumber;
        this.balance = initialBalance;
    }
    
    public void deposit(double amount) {
        if (amount > 0) {
            balance += amount;
        }
    }
    
    public void withdraw(double amount) {
        if (amount > 0 && amount <= balance) {
            balance -= amount;
        }
    }
    
    public double getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }
    
    public String getAccountNumber() {
        return accountNumber;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BankAccount account = new BankAccount("123456789", 1000.0);
        account.deposit(500.0);
        account.withdraw(200.0);
        System.out.println("Balance: " + account.getBalance());
    }
}
```

### Inheritance Example
```java
public class Animal {
    protected String name;
    
    public Animal(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
    
    public void eat() {
        System.out.println(name + " is eating.");
    }
    
    public void sleep() {
        System.out.println(name + " is sleeping.");
    }
}

public class Dog extends Animal {
    public Dog(String name) {
        super(name);
    }
    
    public void bark() {
        System.out.println(name + " is barking.");
    }
    
    @Override
    public void eat() {
        System.out.println(name + " is eating dog food.");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog dog = new Dog("Buddy");
        dog.eat();    // Overridden method
        dog.sleep();  // Inherited method
        dog.bark();   // Dog-specific method
    }
}
```

### Polymorphism Example
```java
public class Shape {
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a shape.");
    }
}

public class Circle extends Shape {
    @Override
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a circle.");
    }
}

public class Rectangle extends Shape {
    @Override
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a rectangle.");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Shape shape1 = new Circle();
        Shape shape2 = new Rectangle();
        
        shape1.draw();  // Calls Circle's draw method
        shape2.draw();  // Calls Rectangle's draw method
    }
}
```

### Abstraction Example
```java
public abstract class Vehicle {
    protected String brand;
    
    public Vehicle(String brand) {
        this.brand = brand;
    }
    
    public abstract void start();
    public abstract void stop();
    
    public void honk() {
        System.out.println("Honking the horn!");
    }
}

public class Car extends Vehicle {
    public Car(String brand) {
        super(brand);
    }
    
    @Override
    public void start() {
        System.out.println("Starting the " + brand + " car.");
    }
    
    @Override
    public void stop() {
        System.out.println("Stopping the " + brand + " car.");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Vehicle car = new Car("Toyota");
        car.start();
        car.honk();
        car.stop();
    }
}
```
