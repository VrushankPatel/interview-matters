# Overview

The Spring Framework provides a comprehensive programming and configuration model for modern Java-based enterprise applications - on any kind of deployment platform. A key element of Spring is infrastructural support at the application level: Spring focuses on the "plumbing" of enterprise applications so that teams can focus on application-level business logic, without unnecessary ties to specific deployment environments.

# Detailed Explanation

Spring's core features include:

- **Core technologies**: dependency injection, events, resources, i18n, validation, data binding, type conversion, SpEL, AOP.
- **Testing**: mock objects, TestContext framework, Spring MVC Test, WebTestClient.
- **Data Access**: transactions, DAO support, JDBC, ORM, Marshalling XML.
- **Web Frameworks**: Spring MVC and Spring WebFlux.
- **Integration**: remoting, JMS, JCA, JMX, email, tasks, scheduling, cache and observability.

Spring supports languages like Kotlin, Groovy, and dynamic languages.

# Real-world Examples & Use Cases

- Building web applications with Spring MVC or WebFlux.
- Enterprise applications requiring dependency injection and AOP.
- Microservices with Spring Boot.
- Batch processing with Spring Batch.
- Integration with messaging systems using Spring Integration.

# Code Examples

## Dependency Injection

```java
@Configuration
public class AppConfig {

    @Bean
    public MyService myService() {
        return new MyServiceImpl();
    }
}

@Service
public class MyController {

    @Autowired
    private MyService myService;
}
```

## Spring MVC Controller

```java
@RestController
public class HelloController {

    @GetMapping("/hello")
    public String hello() {
        return "Hello, World!";
    }
}
```
