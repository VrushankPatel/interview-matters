Summary of recent additions
   - dynamic-programming-and-greedy
   - system-design-interview-cases
   - behavioral-star-prep
   - low-latency-systems
   - security-authz-authn-tokens

Conventions
 - Dir naming: kebab-case.
 - README frontmatter fields: title, aliases, tags, created, updated.
 - Tags: use '#java', '#system-design', '#distributed-systems', '#algorithms', '#interviews', '#os', '#networking'.
 - Diagrams: Mermaid only.
 - Code: prefer working Java examples and minimal runnable snippets.
 - STAR: apply for behavioral/system-case explanations.
