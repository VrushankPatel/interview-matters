Summary of recent additions
   - Processed 5 topics: FIX Protocol, ITCH Protocol, OUCH Protocol, Market Data (overview & dissemination), Order Entry Protocols
   - Restructured repository: moved trading protocols to protocols/ subdir, system-design real-world topics to real-world-designs/ subdir, created subdirs for better organization

Conventions
 - Dir naming: kebab-case.
 - README frontmatter fields: title, aliases, tags, created, updated.
 - Tags: use '#java', '#system-design', '#distributed-systems', '#algorithms', '#interviews', '#os', '#networking'.
 - Diagrams: Mermaid only.
 - Code: prefer working Java examples and minimal runnable snippets.
 - STAR: apply for behavioral/system-case explanations.

TODO
    - High-level open design decisions and split criteria for oversized topics.
    - Restructure Plan: Move individual topic directories under appropriate category directories (e.g., backtracking/ under algorithms/). Create subdirs under system-design/ for LLD, HLD. This requires git mv operations.
