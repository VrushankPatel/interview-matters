Summary of recent additions
  - distributed-tracing-and-observability
  - networking-tcp-ip-http2-tls
  - operating-systems-concepts
  - algorithms-and-data-structures
  - graphs-trees-heaps-and-tries

Conventions
 - Dir naming: kebab-case.
 - README frontmatter fields: title, aliases, tags, created, updated.
 - Tags: use '#java', '#system-design', '#distributed-systems', '#algorithms', '#interviews', '#os', '#networking'.
 - Diagrams: Mermaid only.
 - Code: prefer working Java examples and minimal runnable snippets.
 - STAR: apply for behavioral/system-case explanations.
