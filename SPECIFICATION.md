Summary of recent additions
 - java-language-basics
 - oop-design-and-principles
 - jvm-internals-and-classloading
 - garbage-collection-algorithms
 - java-memory-model-and-concurrency

Conventions
 - Dir naming: kebab-case.
 - README frontmatter fields: title, aliases, tags, created, updated.
 - Tags: use '#java', '#system-design', '#distributed-systems', '#algorithms', '#interviews', '#os', '#networking'.
 - Diagrams: Mermaid only.
 - Code: prefer working Java examples and minimal runnable snippets.
 - STAR: apply for behavioral/system-case explanations.
