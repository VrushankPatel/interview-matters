TODO
    - High-level open design decisions and split criteria for oversized topics.
    - Restructure Plan: Move individual topic directories under appropriate category directories (e.g., backtracking/ under algorithms/). Create subdirs under system-design/ for LLD, HLD. This requires git mv operations.
