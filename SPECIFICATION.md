Summary of recent additions
      - Added comprehensive README.md for FIX Protocol, ITCH Protocol, OUCH Protocol, Market Data (overview & dissemination), Order Entry Protocols with detailed explanations, STAR summaries, diagrams, examples, and references. Restructured trading topics into trading/ category and moved numerous directories into appropriate categories (system-design, java, algorithms, devops, cloud, networking, security, os, ml, design-patterns, behavioral, interview) for better organization.

Conventions
 - Dir naming: kebab-case.
 - README frontmatter fields: title, aliases, tags, created, updated.
 - Tags: use '#java', '#system-design', '#distributed-systems', '#algorithms', '#interviews', '#os', '#networking'.
 - Diagrams: Mermaid only.
 - Code: prefer working Java examples and minimal runnable snippets.
 - STAR: apply for behavioral/system-case explanations.
