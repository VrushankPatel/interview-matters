Summary of recent additions
    - Processed 5 topics from PENDING_TOPICS.md (Journey of a Trade, Order Types, Quotes & RFQ workflows, Execution Report, Trade Capture Report) with content verification and interlink updates. Restructured by removing duplicate directories from root (backtracking, divide-and-conquer, facebook-news-feed, instagram-system-design, netflix-video-streaming-architecture) and consolidating under appropriate categories. Created subdirs under system-design/ (LLD, HLD, concepts, real-world-designs). Updated root README index links to point to correct paths.

Conventions
 - Dir naming: kebab-case.
 - README frontmatter fields: title, aliases, tags, created, updated.
 - Tags: use '#java', '#system-design', '#distributed-systems', '#algorithms', '#interviews', '#os', '#networking'.
 - Diagrams: Mermaid only.
 - Code: prefer working Java examples and minimal runnable snippets.
 - STAR: apply for behavioral/system-case explanations.

TODO
    - High-level open design decisions and split criteria for oversized topics.
    - Restructure Plan: Move individual topic directories under appropriate category directories (e.g., backtracking/ under algorithms/). Create subdirs under system-design/ for LLD, HLD. This requires git mv operations.
