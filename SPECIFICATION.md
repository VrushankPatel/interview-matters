Purpose
Autogenerated KB focused on Java, system design, and core CS fundamentals with content aimed at MAANG interview preparation.

Last update
2025-09-25

Summary of recent additions
 - Updated caching-patterns, consistency-models, microservices-architecture, circuit-breaker-pattern, idempotency-in-apis with enhanced content and interlinks

Conventions
 - Dir naming: kebab-case.
 - README frontmatter fields: title, aliases, tags, created, updated.
 - Tags: use '#java', '#system-design', '#distributed-systems', '#algorithms', '#interviews', '#os', '#networking'.
 - Diagrams: Mermaid only.
 - Code: prefer working Java examples and minimal runnable snippets.
 - STAR: apply for behavioral/system-case explanations.
