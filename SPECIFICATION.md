Summary of recent additions
 - design-patterns
 - system-design-basics
 - load-balancing-and-routing
 - caching-strategies
 - database-design-and-indexing

Conventions
 - Dir naming: kebab-case.
 - README frontmatter fields: title, aliases, tags, created, updated.
 - Tags: use '#java', '#system-design', '#distributed-systems', '#algorithms', '#interviews', '#os', '#networking'.
 - Diagrams: Mermaid only.
 - Code: prefer working Java examples and minimal runnable snippets.
 - STAR: apply for behavioral/system-case explanations.
