# Multithreading & Concurrency in Java

## Overview

Multithreading allows concurrent execution of code, improving performance and responsiveness. Concurrency utilities in Java provide tools for safe multithreaded programming.

## Detailed Explanation

## Threads

Creating and managing threads using Thread class or Runnable.

## Synchronization

Using synchronized blocks, locks, and atomic variables.

## Concurrency Utilities

Executors, Futures, and concurrent collections.

## Real-world Examples & Use Cases

- Web servers handling multiple client requests simultaneously.
- GUI applications remaining responsive during long operations.

## Code Examples

```java
public class ThreadExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread t = new Thread(() -> System.out.println("Hello from thread"));
        t.start();
    }
}
```
