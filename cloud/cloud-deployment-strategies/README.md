# Cloud Deployment Strategies

## Overview

Cloud deployment strategies involve methods to deploy applications to cloud platforms efficiently, ensuring scalability, reliability, and cost-effectiveness. They include infrastructure choices, automation, and release patterns.

## Detailed Explanation

### Infrastructure Models

- **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)**: Virtual machines, e.g., EC2, Compute Engine.
- **PaaS (Platform as a Service)**: Managed platforms, e.g., Heroku, App Engine.
- **Serverless**: Function-based, e.g., AWS Lambda, Cloud Functions.

### Deployment Patterns

- **Blue-Green Deployment**: Two identical environments, switch traffic.
- **Canary Deployment**: Roll out to subset of users.
- **Rolling Deployment**: Update instances gradually.

### Automation Tools

- Terraform: Infrastructure as Code.
- Ansible: Configuration management.
- CI/CD Pipelines: Jenkins, GitHub Actions.

### Multi-Cloud and Hybrid

- Strategies for deploying across providers or on-premises + cloud.

## Real-world Examples & Use Cases

- **E-commerce**: Blue-green on AWS for zero-downtime releases.
- **SaaS Apps**: Serverless on Azure for auto-scaling.
- **Enterprise**: Hybrid cloud with Kubernetes for portability.

## Code Examples

### Terraform for AWS EC2

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  ami           = "ami-12345678"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  tags = {
    Name = "WebServer"
  }
}
```

### Docker Compose for Local Cloud Simulation

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  app:
    image: myapp:latest
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
  db:
    image: postgres:13
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password
```

### GitHub Actions CI/CD

```yaml
name: Deploy to AWS
on: [push]
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Deploy
        run: aws ecs update-service --cluster my-cluster --service my-service --force-new-deployment
```

## Common Pitfalls & Edge Cases

- Vendor lock-in.
- Cost overruns.
- Security misconfigurations.
- Handling stateful applications in serverless.
