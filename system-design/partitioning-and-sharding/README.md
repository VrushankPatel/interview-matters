## Overview
Partitioning and sharding are techniques to distribute data across multiple storage units for improved performance, scalability, and availability. Partitioning divides a dataset into smaller, manageable pieces, while sharding distributes these partitions across different servers. This is essential for handling large-scale data in distributed systems and is a common interview topic for designing scalable databases.

## STAR Summary
**Situation:** An e-commerce platform with a monolithic database experienced slow queries and downtime during peak traffic (1M+ users).  
**Task:** Scale the database to support 10x growth in users and data volume without compromising performance.  
**Action:** Implemented horizontal sharding using consistent hashing, with automatic rebalancing and replication.  
**Result:** Reduced average query latency from 500ms to 200ms, achieved 99.9% uptime, and supported seamless scaling to 100M users.

## Detailed Explanation
- **Partitioning Types:** Range (e.g., by date), Hash (modulo on key), List (explicit lists).
- **Sharding Strategies:** Directory-based (lookup table), Consistent Hashing (ring-based for even distribution).
- **Key Concepts:** Shard key selection, rebalancing, cross-shard queries, replication for fault tolerance.
- **Tradeoffs:** Increased complexity vs. linear scalability; potential for uneven load (hot shards).

## Real-world Examples & Use Cases
- **Social Networks:** Sharding user data by user ID in Facebook's TAO system.
- **E-commerce:** Product catalogs sharded by category in Amazon DynamoDB.
- **Analytics:** Time-series data partitioned by timestamp in InfluxDB.

## Code Examples
### Consistent Hashing Implementation in Java
```java
import java.util.*;

class ConsistentHashing {
    private SortedMap<Integer, String> ring = new TreeMap<>();
    private int replicas = 3;

    public void addNode(String node) {
        for (int i = 0; i < replicas; i++) {
            int hash = (node + i).hashCode();
            ring.put(hash, node);
        }
    }

    public String getNode(String key) {
        if (ring.isEmpty()) return null;
        int hash = key.hashCode();
        if (!ring.containsKey(hash)) {
            SortedMap<Integer, String> tailMap = ring.tailMap(hash);
            hash = tailMap.isEmpty() ? ring.firstKey() : tailMap.firstKey();
        }
        return ring.get(hash);
    }
}
```

## Data Models / Message Formats
| Shard ID | Range Start | Range End | Server | Replicas |
|----------|-------------|-----------|--------|----------|
| 1        | 0           | 999       | server1| server2, server3 |
| 2        | 1000        | 1999      | server2| server1, server3 |

## Journey / Sequence
```mermaid

    participant Client
    participant Router
    participant Shard1
    participant Shard2

    Client->>Router: Query for user 123
    Router->>Router: Hash key to find shard
    Router->>Shard1: Forward query
    Shard1->>Router: Return data
    Router->>Client: Response
```

## Common Pitfalls & Edge Cases
- Hot shards from poor key distribution.
- Rebalancing during peak load causing downtime.
- Cross-shard joins requiring application-level logic.
- Edge case: Single shard failure affecting availability if not replicated.

## Tools & Libraries
- **Databases:** Cassandra (automatic partitioning), MongoDB (sharding).
- **Libraries:** Apache Commons ConsistentHash, Netflix's Dynomite for sharding.
- **Frameworks:** Spring Data with sharding support.
