# Airbnb Booking System

## Overview

The Airbnb Booking System designs a distributed platform for vacation rentals, focusing on ensuring consistency in booking operations to prevent double-bookings and maintain transactional integrity across microservices. Key challenges include handling high concurrency, network partitions, and partial failures while providing strong consistency guarantees.

## Detailed Explanation

### System Architecture

The system employs a microservices architecture with distributed databases to achieve scalability and fault tolerance. Core services include user management, listing management, booking coordination, payment processing, and notifications.

    C --> H[Listing DB]
    D --> I[Booking DB]
    D --> J[Distributed Lock Service (Redis)]
    E --> K[Payment Gateway]
```

#### Key Components

- **API Gateway**: Routes requests and handles authentication.
- **User Service**: Manages user profiles and authentication.
- **Listing Service**: Handles property listings, search, and availability checks.
- **Booking Service**: Orchestrates bookings, ensuring consistency.
- **Payment Service**: Integrates with payment providers for secure transactions.
- **Notification Service**: Sends emails/SMS for confirmations and updates.

### Consistency Mechanisms

To achieve distributed consistency:

- **Distributed Locks**: Use Redis Redlock algorithm to lock properties during booking to prevent concurrent modifications.
- **Saga Pattern**: Implement compensating transactions for multi-step operations like booking and payment.
- **Optimistic Concurrency Control**: Version-based checks in databases to detect conflicts.
- **Eventual Consistency with CQRS**: Separate read/write models for high availability.

For bookings, acquire a lock on the property ID, check availability, process payment, and release lock. If payment fails, compensate by canceling the tentative booking.

## Real-world Examples & Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Standard Booking Flow

1. User searches for properties via Listing Service.
2. Selects dates and initiates booking.
3. Booking Service acquires distributed lock on property.
4. Checks availability in Listing DB.
5. Creates tentative booking in Booking DB.
6. Calls Payment Service to charge user.
7. On success, confirms booking and sends notification.
8. Releases lock.

### Use Case 2: High-Traffic Scenario (Holiday Peak)

- Scale horizontally with database sharding by region.
- Use load balancers and auto-scaling for services.
- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse.

### Use Case 3: Cancellation and Refund

- Use Saga to reverse payment and update availability.
- Ensure idempotency to handle duplicate requests.

## Code Examples

### Java Pseudocode for Booking Logic

```java
@Service
public class BookingService {

    @Autowired
    private LockManager lockManager;

    @Autowired
    private ListingService listingService;

    @Autowired
    private PaymentService paymentService;

    @Autowired
    private BookingRepository bookingRepository;

    public BookingResult bookProperty(String propertyId, DateRange dates, User user) {
        String lockKey = "property:" + propertyId;
        if (!lockManager.acquireLock(lockKey, 30)) { // 30s timeout
            return BookingResult.CONFLICT;
        }
        try {
            if (!listingService.isAvailable(propertyId, dates)) {
                return BookingResult.UNAVAILABLE;
            }
            Booking booking = new Booking(propertyId, dates, user);
            PaymentResult payment = paymentService.charge(user, booking.getTotalPrice());
            if (payment.isSuccess()) {
                bookingRepository.save(booking);
                listingService.markUnavailable(propertyId, dates);
                return BookingResult.SUCCESS;
            } else {
                return BookingResult.PAYMENT_FAILED;
            }
        } finally {
            lockManager.releaseLock(lockKey);
        }
    }
}
```

### Python Example for Distributed Lock with Redis

```python
import redis
import time

class RedisLock:
    def __init__(self, redis_client):
        self.redis = redis_client

    def acquire(self, key, ttl=30):
        return self.redis.set(key, 'locked', ex=ttl, nx=True)

    def release(self, key):
        self.redis.delete(key)

# Usage
lock = RedisLock(redis_client)
if lock.acquire('property:123'):
    try:
        # Perform booking logic
        pass
    finally:
        lock.release('property:123')
```

### Table: Comparison of Consistency Approaches

| Approach | Consistency Level | Performance Impact | Use Case |
|----------|-------------------|---------------------|----------|
| Distributed Locks | Strong | High (blocking) | Critical sections like booking |
| Optimistic Locking | Strong on commit | Medium | Low contention scenarios |
| Saga Pattern | Eventual | Low | Complex transactions |
| Event Sourcing | Eventual | Low | Audit trails and replay |

## Common Pitfalls & Edge Cases

- **Race Conditions**: Without locks, multiple bookings can succeed simultaneously. Mitigate with locks or versioning.
- **Network Partitions**: Use quorum-based decisions or fallback to eventual consistency.
- **Partial Failures**: Implement retries with exponential backoff and circuit breakers.
- **Idempotency**: Ensure operations are safe to repeat, e.g., via unique request IDs.
- **Clock Skew**: Use logical clocks or NTP for distributed timestamps.
- **Overbooking**: Rare but possible; implement monitoring and manual overrides.

## Tools & Libraries

- **Redis**: For distributed locks and caching.
- **Apache Kafka**: For event-driven communication between services.
- **Spring Cloud**: For microservice coordination and config management.
- **Kubernetes**: For container orchestration and scaling.
- **PostgreSQL with Citus**: For distributed SQL database.
- **Stripe/PayPal SDKs**: For payment integration.
