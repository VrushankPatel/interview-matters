# System Design Basics

## Overview

System design involves designing scalable, reliable, and efficient systems. Basics cover key concepts like scalability, availability, consistency, and trade-offs.

## Detailed Explanation

### Key Principles

- **Scalability**: Handling growth in users/data.

- **Availability**: System uptime.

- **Consistency**: Data accuracy.

- **Partition Tolerance**: Fault tolerance.

### CAP Theorem

You can only have 2 out of 3: Consistency, Availability, Partition Tolerance.

## Real-world Examples & Use Cases

- **Load Balancers**: Distribute traffic.

- **Databases**: SQL vs NoSQL.

- **Caching**: Redis for speed.
