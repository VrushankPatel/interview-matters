## Overview
System design basics cover the fundamental principles and components for designing scalable, reliable, and efficient software systems. It involves understanding requirements, trade-offs, and architectural patterns.

## Detailed Explanation
- **Requirements Gathering:** Functional and non-functional requirements (scalability, availability, etc.).
- **Components:** Load balancers, databases, caches, message queues.
- **Scalability:** Vertical vs horizontal scaling.
- **Availability:** Redundancy, failover.
- **Performance:** Latency, throughput.

## Real-world Examples & Use Cases
- Designing a web application to handle millions of users.
- Building a chat system with real-time messaging.
- E-commerce platform with inventory management.

## Code Examples
### Simple Load Balancer Pseudo-code
```python
class LoadBalancer:
    def __init__(self, servers):
        self.servers = servers
        self.index = 0

    def get_server(self):
        server = self.servers[self.index]
        self.index = (self.index + 1) % len(self.servers)
        return server
```

## Data Models / Message Formats
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Client] --> B[Load Balancer]
    B --> C[Web Server 1]
    B --> D[Web Server 2]
    C --> E[Database]
    D --> E
```

## Common Pitfalls & Edge Cases
- Ignoring bottlenecks in single points of failure.
- Over-scaling prematurely.
- Not considering data consistency.

## Tools & Libraries
- AWS, GCP for cloud services.
- Nginx for load balancing.
