# Kotlin for Java Developers

## Overview

Kotlin is a modern programming language that runs on the JVM and is fully interoperable with Java. It's designed to be more concise and safe than Java, making it a popular choice for Android development and server-side applications.

## Detailed Explanation

Key differences and features:

- Null safety with nullable and non-nullable types.
- Data classes for boilerplate reduction.
- Extension functions.
- Coroutines for asynchronous programming.
- Smart casts and type inference.
- Inline functions and higher-order functions.

## Real-world Examples & Use Cases

- Android app development.
- Backend services with Spring.
- DSL creation.

## Code Examples

### Null Safety

```kotlin
var name: String? = null
val length = name?.length ?: 0
```

### Data Class

```kotlin
data class User(val name: String, val age: Int)
val user = User("Alice", 30)
```

### Extension Function

```kotlin
fun String.isEmail(): Boolean = contains("@")
val isValid = "test@example.com".isEmail()
```
