# Overview

Order entry protocols enable the submission of buy/sell orders to trading venues. They define message formats for new orders, modifications, and cancellations, ensuring reliable communication between traders and exchanges.

# STAR Summary

**SITUATION**: Manual order entry was slow; electronic systems needed standardized protocols.

**TASK**: Develop protocols for automated order submission.

**ACTION**: Exchanges like NASDAQ created OUCH; FIX provided a universal standard.

**RESULT**: Enabled algorithmic trading and direct market access.

# Detailed Explanation

Key protocols:
- **FIX**: Versatile, used globally.
- **OUCH**: NASDAQ-specific, binary for speed.
- **Proprietary**: Venue-specific APIs.

Features: Authentication, validation, sequencing.

# Real-world Examples & Use Cases

Brokers use FIX for multi-venue routing; HFT uses OUCH for latency.

Sample OUCH Enter Order as above.

# Message Formats / Data Models

# Common Pitfalls & Edge Cases
