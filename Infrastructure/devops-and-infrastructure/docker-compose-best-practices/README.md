# Docker Compose Best Practices

## Overview

Docker Compose best practices ensure efficient, maintainable, and secure multi-container applications. They cover file structure, configuration, security, and performance.

## Detailed Explanation

### File Structure

- Use `docker-compose.yml` for base config.
- Override with `docker-compose.override.yml` for dev.
- Environment-specific files like `docker-compose.prod.yml`.

### Services Configuration

- Define services clearly with images, ports, volumes.
- Use environment variables for configuration.
- Health checks for dependencies.

### Networking and Volumes

- Use named networks for isolation.
- Persistent volumes for data.
- Avoid host volumes for portability.

### Security

- Don't run as root.
- Use secrets for sensitive data.
- Scan images for vulnerabilities.

### Performance

- Multi-stage builds.
- Resource limits.
- Optimize image layers.

## Real-world Examples & Use Cases

- **Web App Development**: Compose for local dev with app, DB, cache.
- **Microservices**: Orchestrating multiple services locally.
- **Testing**: Isolated environments for CI.

## Code Examples

### Basic docker-compose.yml

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  web:
    image: nginx:alpine
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
    volumes:
      - ./html:/usr/share/nginx/html
  db:
    image: postgres:13
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password
    volumes:
      - db_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
volumes:
  db_data:
```

### With Health Checks

```yaml
services:
  db:
    image: postgres:13
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD-SHELL", "pg_isready -U postgres"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 3
  app:
    image: myapp
    depends_on:
      db:
        condition: service_healthy
```

### Environment Overrides

```yaml
# docker-compose.override.yml
services:
  web:
    environment:
      DEBUG: true
```

## Common Pitfalls & Edge Cases

- Port conflicts.
- Data persistence issues.
- Scaling services incorrectly.
- Ignoring logs and monitoring.
