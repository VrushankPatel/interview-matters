# Zookeeper for Coordination

## Overview

Apache ZooKeeper is a distributed coordination service that provides primitives for building distributed applications. It offers a simple interface for name service, configuration management, distributed synchronization, and group services.

## Detailed Explanation

ZooKeeper maintains a hierarchical namespace of znodes, similar to a file system. It provides guarantees about ordering, atomicity, and durability.

### Key Features

- **Znodes**: Data nodes in the hierarchy
- **Watches**: Notification mechanism for changes
- **Ephemeral nodes**: Exist only while session is active
- **Sequential nodes**: Auto-incrementing names

### Common Recipes

- Leader election
- Distributed locks
- Configuration management
- Group membership

```mermaid

    A[ZooKeeper Ensemble] --> B[Leader]
    A --> C[Follower 1]
    A --> D[Follower 2]
    B --> E[Zab Protocol]
    C --> E
    D --> E
    F[Client] --> A
```

## Real-world Examples & Use Cases

- Apache Kafka: Topic management and broker coordination
- Apache Hadoop: Namenode coordination
- Distributed databases: Configuration and leader election

## Code Examples

### Java ZooKeeper Client

```java
import org.apache.zookeeper.*;

public class ZKClient implements Watcher {
    private ZooKeeper zk;
    
    public ZKClient(String connectString) throws Exception {
        zk = new ZooKeeper(connectString, 3000, this);
    }
    
    public void createNode(String path, byte[] data) throws Exception {
        zk.create(path, data, ZooDefs.Ids.OPEN_ACL_UNSAFE, CreateMode.PERSISTENT);
    }
    
    public byte[] getData(String path) throws Exception {
        return zk.getData(path, true, null);
    }
    
    @Override
    public void process(WatchedEvent event) {
        System.out.println("Event: " + event.getType() + " " + event.getPath());
    }
}
```

### Leader Election Recipe

```java
public class LeaderElection implements Watcher {
    // Implementation of leader election using ephemeral sequential nodes
    // When the lowest numbered node, become leader
}
```
