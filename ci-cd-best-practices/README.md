## Overview

CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) best practices ensure fast, reliable, and secure software delivery. They involve automating build, test, and deployment processes to reduce errors and improve collaboration.

## Detailed Explanation

### CI Principles
- Frequent commits and automated builds.
- Automated testing (unit, integration, e2e).
- Fast feedback loops.

### CD Principles
- Automated deployments to staging/production.
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC).
- Rollback strategies.

### Tools
- Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, CircleCI.

```

## Real-world Examples & Use Cases

- **Web Application**: Use GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment on every PR.
- **Mobile App**: Jenkins pipeline for building, signing, and distributing iOS/Android apps.
- **Microservices**: GitLab CI for deploying services to Kubernetes with canary releases.

## Code Examples

### GitHub Actions Workflow
```yaml
name: CI/CD
on: [push]
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Run tests
      run: npm test
    - name: Deploy
      run: ./deploy.sh
```

### Jenkins Pipeline
```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn clean compile'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn test'
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                sh './deploy.sh'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Common Pitfalls & Edge Cases

- **Flaky Tests**: Tests that pass/fail intermittently; use retries, isolate dependencies, and monitor failure patterns.
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Regularly scan dependencies with tools like Snyk or OWASP Dependency-Check; automate security gates.
- **Environment Differences**: Staging vs. production discrepancies; use Docker for consistent environments and infrastructure as code.
- **Long Build Times**: Optimize by caching dependencies, parallelizing jobs, and using faster runners.
- **Manual Approvals Bottlenecks**: Balance automation with necessary human oversight; use automated canary deployments.
- **Rollback Failures**: Test rollback procedures; ensure immutable deployments with versioning.

## Tools & Libraries

| Tool | Description | Key Features |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| Jenkins | Open-source automation server | Extensible plugins, pipeline as code, on-prem hosting |
| GitHub Actions | CI/CD integrated with GitHub | Free for public repos, marketplace of actions, YAML workflows |
| GitLab CI/CD | Built-in CI/CD for GitLab | Auto DevOps, Kubernetes integration, comprehensive security scanning |
| CircleCI | Cloud-native CI/CD | Fast builds, orbs for reusable configs, Docker support |
| Travis CI | Hosted CI service | Simple setup, matrix builds, integration with GitHub |
