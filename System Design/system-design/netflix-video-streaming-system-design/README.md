# Netflix Video Streaming System Design

## Overview

Netflix is a global video streaming platform serving over 270 million subscribers with personalized content recommendations, high-quality video playback, and seamless user experience. The system handles massive scale: billions of hours of content streamed daily, petabytes of data, and real-time analytics. Key challenges include content delivery at scale, adaptive bitrate streaming, personalization, and global distribution.

## Detailed Explanation

### Requirements
- **Functional**: Video upload/encoding, user authentication, content catalog, recommendations, playback with adaptive bitrate.
- **Non-Functional**: Low latency (<1s for startup), high availability (99.99%), scalability to millions of concurrent streams, cost efficiency.

### High-Level Architecture
- **Content Ingestion**: Upload and encode videos.
- **Storage**: Distributed storage for video files.
- **CDN**: Global content delivery.
- **API Services**: User management, recommendations.
- **Client Apps**: Web, mobile, smart TVs.

```

### Low-Level Design
- **Video Encoding**: Transcode to multiple formats/bitrate using FFmpeg or similar.
- **Adaptive Streaming**: HLS/DASH protocols for quality switching.
- **Personalization**: ML models for recommendations using collaborative filtering.
- **Caching**: Edge caching in CDN for popular content.

## Real-world Examples & Use Cases
- Streaming 4K content during peak hours.
- Personalized recommendations based on viewing history.
- Offline downloads for mobile users.

## Code Examples

### Simple Video Encoding (Python with FFmpeg)
```python
import subprocess

def encode_video(input_file, output_file, bitrate='1000k'):
    cmd = [
        'ffmpeg',
        '-i', input_file,
        '-b:v', bitrate,
        '-c:v', 'libx264',
        '-c:a', 'aac',
        output_file
    ]
    subprocess.run(cmd)
```

### Recommendation Engine (Simplified)
```java
public class RecommendationService {
    public List<Video> recommend(String userId) {
        // Fetch user history
        List<String> watched = userDao.getWatchedVideos(userId);
        // Collaborative filtering
        return mlModel.predictSimilar(watched);
    }
}
```
