# Spotify System Design Architecture

## Overview

Spotify is a leading music streaming platform that delivers personalized music experiences to over 400 million users worldwide. The system handles massive audio content libraries, real-time streaming, personalized recommendations, and social features. Key challenges include low-latency audio delivery, content personalization at scale, copyright management, and handling peak loads during major releases.

The architecture leverages distributed systems, machine learning, and edge computing to provide seamless streaming experiences across devices.

## Detailed Explanation

### Core Architecture Components

Spotify's architecture is built on microservices with a focus on scalability, reliability, and user experience.

#### 1. Content Delivery Network (CDN)
- **Purpose**: Distributes audio content globally with low latency
- **Technology**: Custom CDN with edge caching, adaptive bitrate streaming
- **Features**:
  - HLS/DASH protocols for adaptive streaming
  - Regional content replication
  - Bandwidth optimization

#### 2. Audio Storage and Processing
- **Purpose**: Stores and processes audio files in multiple formats
- **Technology**: Distributed storage (Ceph), audio transcoding pipelines
- **Features**: Multi-format encoding (MP3, OGG, AAC), quality optimization

#### 3. Recommendation Engine
- **Purpose**: Provides personalized music suggestions
- **Technology**: Machine learning models (collaborative filtering, deep learning)
- **Features**:
  - Real-time recommendations
  - Playlist generation
  - Discovery features

#### 4. User Data and Metadata
- **Purpose**: Manages user profiles, playlists, and music metadata
- **Technology**: Cassandra for user data, PostgreSQL for metadata
- **Features**: Sharded databases, eventual consistency

#### 5. Social and Collaborative Features
- **Purpose**: Enables sharing, following, and social discovery
- **Technology**: Graph database (Neo4j) for social relationships
- **Features**: Friend networks, collaborative playlists

### Scalability Challenges and Solutions

| Challenge | Solution | Impact |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| Global audio delivery | Multi-CDN with edge caching | <200ms latency worldwide |
| Massive content library | Distributed storage with replication | 80M+ tracks available |
| Real-time recommendations | Distributed ML inference | Personalized experience for 400M+ users |
| Peak load handling | Auto-scaling and load shedding | Stable during viral releases |
| Copyright compliance | Digital rights management | Legal streaming for all content |

```

### Data Flow

1. **Authentication**: User logs in via OAuth, session established
2. **Content Discovery**: Recommendations fetched from ML services
3. **Streaming Request**: Audio URL resolved through CDN
4. **Playback**: Adaptive streaming based on network conditions
5. **Analytics**: User behavior tracked for improved recommendations

### Streaming Optimizations

- **Adaptive Bitrate**: Adjusts quality based on connection speed
- **Caching**: Local device caching and CDN edge caching
- **Pre-buffering**: Predictive loading for seamless playback
- **Compression**: Audio codecs optimized for quality vs. bandwidth

## Real-world Examples & Use Cases

### Personalized Playlists
- **Use Case**: Daily Mix and Discover Weekly playlists
- **Requirements**: ML-driven recommendations based on listening history
- **Scale**: Generated for millions of users daily

### Social Music Discovery
- **Use Case**: Following friends and seeing their activity
- **Features**: Collaborative playlists, shared listening sessions
- **Benefits**: Community-driven music discovery

### Live Events and Podcasts
- **Use Case**: Streaming concerts and exclusive content
- **Integration**: Real-time broadcasting with low latency
- **Scale**: Handles millions of concurrent viewers

### Artist and Label Tools
- **Use Case**: Analytics and distribution for creators
- **Features**: Streaming data, royalty tracking, direct uploads
- **Security**: Secure content management

## Code Examples

### Audio Streaming Request (Java)

```java
public class SpotifyStreamingClient {
    private final HttpClient client = HttpClient.newHttpClient();

    public CompletableFuture<byte[]> streamChunk(String trackId, int offset) {
        HttpRequest request = HttpRequest.newBuilder()
            .uri(URI.create("https://api.spotify.com/v1/tracks/" + trackId + "/stream?offset=" + offset))
            .header("Authorization", "Bearer " + accessToken)
            .build();

        return client.sendAsync(request, HttpResponse.BodyHandlers.ofByteArray())
            .thenApply(HttpResponse::body);
    }
}
```

### Recommendation Service (Python)

```python
from sklearn.neighbors import NearestNeighbors
import numpy as np

class RecommendationEngine:
    def __init__(self, user_embeddings):
        self.model = NearestNeighbors(n_neighbors=10)
        self.model.fit(user_embeddings)

    def get_recommendations(self, user_id, user_vector):
        distances, indices = self.model.kneighbors([user_vector])
        return indices[0]  # Return similar user indices
```

### Playlist Generation (Scala)

```scala
case class Track(id: String, features: Vector[Double])
case class Playlist(tracks: Seq[Track])

object PlaylistGenerator {
  def generateDailyMix(userHistory: Seq[Track], seedTracks: Seq[Track]): Playlist = {
    val similarTracks = findSimilarTracks(userHistory, seedTracks)
    Playlist(seedTracks ++ similarTracks.take(20))
  }

  private def findSimilarTracks(history: Seq[Track], seeds: Seq[Track]): Seq[Track] = {
    // Cosine similarity calculation
    seeds.flatMap(seed => 
      history.filter(track => cosineSimilarity(seed.features, track.features) > 0.7)
    ).distinct
  }
}
```

## Common Pitfalls & Edge Cases

- **Copyright Infringement**: Robust DRM and content ID systems
- **Network Interruptions**: Resume playback with minimal buffering
- **Device Synchronization**: Maintain playlist state across devices
- **Peak Demand**: Auto-scaling during major releases
- **Audio Quality**: Balance quality with bandwidth constraints
- **Offline Mode**: Secure local caching for premium users

## Tools & Libraries

- **Streaming**: HLS.js for web, ExoPlayer for Android
- **ML**: TensorFlow, PyTorch for recommendations
- **Storage**: Cassandra for user data, Ceph for audio
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL for metadata, Neo4j for social graphs
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana for metrics
- **Backend**: Scala/Akka for microservices
