# Overview

Multithreading allows multiple threads to run concurrently. Concurrency utilities in Java include Thread, Runnable, synchronized, locks, executors.

# Detailed Explanation

## Threads

Creating threads with Thread class or Runnable.

## Synchronization

Using synchronized blocks, ReentrantLock.

## Concurrency Utilities

ExecutorService, Future, CompletableFuture.

# Real-world Examples & Use Cases

- Building responsive UI applications.
- Server-side applications handling multiple requests.

# Code Examples

```java
// Creating a thread
public class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread running");
    }
}
```

```java
// Using ExecutorService
ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(10);
executor.submit(() -> System.out.println("Task executed"));
```
