# Multithreading & Concurrency in Java

## Overview

Multithreading allows Java programs to execute multiple threads concurrently, improving performance and responsiveness. Concurrency utilities provide safe and efficient thread management.

## Detailed Explanation

### Threads

- Lightweight processes
- Created by extending `Thread` or implementing `Runnable`
- States: New, Runnable, Blocked, Waiting, Timed Waiting, Terminated

### Synchronization

- `synchronized` keyword for mutual exclusion
- Prevents race conditions

### Concurrency Utilities

- `ExecutorService` for thread pools
- `Lock` interfaces for advanced locking
- Atomic variables for lock-free operations

### Thread Safety

Ensuring shared data is accessed safely by multiple threads.

## Real-world Examples & Use Cases

- Web servers handling multiple requests
- GUI applications remaining responsive
- Parallel data processing

## Code Examples

### Creating Threads

```java
public class MyThread extends Thread {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread running");
    }
}

public class RunnableExample implements Runnable {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Runnable running");
    }
}
```

### Synchronization

```java
public class Counter {
    private int count = 0;

    public synchronized void increment() {
        count++;
    }

    public int getCount() {
        return count;
    }
}
```

### Using ExecutorService

```java
ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(10);
executor.submit(() -> {
    System.out.println("Task executed");
});
executor.shutdown();
```

## Common Pitfalls & Edge Cases

- Deadlocks from improper lock ordering
- Race conditions in unsynchronized code
- Thread leaks in thread pools

## Tools & Libraries

- `java.util.concurrent` package
- JVisualVM for thread monitoring
