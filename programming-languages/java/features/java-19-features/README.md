## Overview

Java 19, released in September 2022, is a non-LTS release featuring preview versions of record patterns, virtual threads, and structured concurrency. It also includes enhancements to the foreign function and memory API, and improvements to the Linux/RISC-V port. This release continues the evolution towards more expressive and performant Java code.

## Detailed Explanation

Java 19 introduces several preview features that aim to simplify common programming patterns and improve concurrency handling. Key features include:

### Record Patterns (Preview)
Allows pattern matching with records, enabling destructuring of record components.

### Virtual Threads (Preview)
Lightweight threads that dramatically reduce the effort of writing, maintaining, and debugging high-throughput concurrent applications.

### Structured Concurrency (Preview)
Simplifies concurrent programming by treating multiple tasks running in different threads as a single unit of work.

### Foreign Function & Memory API (Third Incubator)
Further refinements to the API for calling native code and managing native memory.

### Other Features
- Vector API (Third Incubator)
- Linux/RISC-V Port
- Deprecations and security updates

## Real-world Examples & Use Cases

### Record Patterns for Data Extraction
Simplify working with nested record structures.

```java
public record Point(int x, int y) {}
public record Rectangle(Point topLeft, Point bottomRight) {}

public void printArea(Rectangle rect) {
    if (rect instanceof Rectangle(Point(var x1, var y1), Point(var x2, var y2))) {
        int width = Math.abs(x2 - x1);
        int height = Math.abs(y2 - y1);
        System.out.println("Area: " + (width * height));
    }
}
```

### Virtual Threads for High Concurrency
Handle thousands of concurrent connections efficiently.

```java
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;

public class VirtualThreadExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (var executor = Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor()) {
            for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
                executor.submit(() -> {
                    // Simulate some work
                    try {
                        Thread.sleep(1000);
                        System.out.println("Task completed on " + Thread.currentThread());
                    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                        Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
                    }
                });
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Structured Concurrency for Task Coordination
Ensure related tasks complete together or fail together.

```java
import java.util.concurrent.StructuredTaskScope;

public class StructuredConcurrencyExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        try (var scope = new StructuredTaskScope.ShutdownOnFailure()) {
            var task1 = scope.fork(() -> fetchData("service1"));
            var task2 = scope.fork(() -> fetchData("service2"));
            
            scope.join();
            scope.throwIfFailed();
            
            String result1 = task1.get();
            String result2 = task2.get();
            
            System.out.println("Results: " + result1 + ", " + result2);
        }
    }
    
    private static String fetchData(String service) {
        // Simulate API call
        return "Data from " + service;
    }
}
```

## Code Examples

### Complete Record Patterns Example

```java
public record Person(String name, int age) {}
public record Address(String street, String city) {}
public record Contact(Person person, Address address) {}

public class RecordPatternExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Contact contact = new Contact(
            new Person("John Doe", 30),
            new Address("123 Main St", "Anytown")
        );
        
        // Using record patterns
        if (contact instanceof Contact(Person(var name, var age), Address(var street, var city))) {
            System.out.println(name + " (" + age + ") lives at " + street + ", " + city);
        }
    }
}
```

### Virtual Threads with ServerSocket

```java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.net.ServerSocket;
import java.net.Socket;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;

public class VirtualThreadServer {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(8080);
        System.out.println("Server listening on port 8080");
        
        try (var executor = Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor()) {
            while (true) {
                Socket clientSocket = serverSocket.accept();
                executor.submit(() -> handleClient(clientSocket));
            }
        }
    }
    
    private static void handleClient(Socket socket) {
        try (socket) {
            // Handle client request
            System.out.println("Handling client on " + Thread.currentThread());
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```
