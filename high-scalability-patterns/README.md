## Overview

High scalability patterns address challenges in building systems that can handle massive loads. Patterns include sharding, replication, caching, and microservices, enabling horizontal and vertical scaling.

## Detailed Explanation

### Key Patterns
- **Sharding**: Splitting data across multiple databases.
- **Replication**: Copying data for redundancy and read performance.
- **Caching**: Storing frequently accessed data in memory.
- **Microservices**: Decomposing monolithic apps into services.
- **Load Balancing**: Distributing requests across servers.

### Trade-offs
- Sharding improves write performance but complicates queries.
- Replication ensures availability but may lead to consistency issues.

    A --> C[Microservice 2]
    B --> D[Database Shard 1]
    C --> E[Database Shard 2]
    D --> F[Cache]
    E --> F
```

## Real-world Examples & Use Cases

- **Netflix**: Uses microservices and caching for streaming.
- **Amazon**: Sharding for product databases.
- **Google**: Replication for search index.

## Code Examples

### Simple Sharding Logic (Pseudocode)
```python
def get_shard(user_id, num_shards):
    return user_id % num_shards

# Usage
shard = get_shard(12345, 4)  # 1
```
