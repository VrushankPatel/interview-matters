# Overview

DevOps combines software development and IT operations to shorten the development lifecycle. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) treats infrastructure provisioning as code.

# Detailed Explanation

DevOps emphasizes collaboration, automation, and monitoring. IaC uses tools like Terraform, Ansible to define and manage infrastructure programmatically.

## Key Principles

- Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
- Automation of repetitive tasks
- Version control for infrastructure

# Real-world Examples & Use Cases

- Automating server provisioning in cloud environments
- Managing multi-environment deployments

# Code Examples

```hcl
# Terraform example for AWS EC2 instance
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1d0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  tags = {
    Name = "ExampleInstance"
  }
}
```

```yaml
# Ansible playbook example
---
- name: Install Nginx
  hosts: webservers
  tasks:
    - name: Install nginx
      apt:
        name: nginx
        state: present
```
