# DevOps & Infrastructure as Code

## Overview

DevOps combines development and operations to improve collaboration and automate processes. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) treats infrastructure provisioning as software code, enabling version control, testing, and automation.

## Detailed Explanation

### DevOps Principles

- **Culture**: Collaboration between dev and ops teams.
- **Automation**: CI/CD pipelines for faster releases.
- **Measurement**: Monitoring and feedback loops.
- **Sharing**: Shared responsibility for quality.

### Infrastructure as Code

IaC tools define infrastructure in code files, allowing declarative or imperative provisioning.

- **Declarative**: Specify desired state (e.g., Terraform).
- **Imperative**: Step-by-step instructions (e.g., Ansible).

Benefits: Consistency, repeatability, version control, reduced errors.

## Real-world Examples & Use Cases

- **Cloud Deployment**: Use Terraform to provision AWS resources.
- **Configuration Management**: Ansible for server setup.
- **CI/CD**: Jenkins/GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment.

## Code Examples

### Terraform for AWS EC2

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1d0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}
```

### Ansible Playbook

```yaml
---
- hosts: webservers
  tasks:
    - name: Install nginx
      apt:
        name: nginx
        state: present
```
