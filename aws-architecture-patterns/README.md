# AWS Architecture Patterns

## Overview

AWS provides a suite of services that enable various architecture patterns for scalable, resilient, and cost-effective applications.

## Detailed Explanation

- Serverless with Lambda and API Gateway.
- Microservices with ECS/Fargate or EKS.
- Event-driven with SQS, SNS, EventBridge.
- Data lake with S3, Glue, Athena.
- CDN with CloudFront.

## Real-world Examples & Use Cases

- Serverless APIs for mobile backends.
- Big data processing with EMR.
- Global applications with multi-region deployments.

## Code Examples

### Lambda Function

```javascript
exports.handler = async (event) => {
    console.log('Event: ', event);
    return {
        statusCode: 200,
        body: JSON.stringify('Hello from Lambda!'),
    };
};
```

### CloudFormation Template

```yaml
AWSTemplateFormatVersion: '2010-09-09'
Resources:
  MyBucket:
    Type: 'AWS::S3::Bucket'
    Properties:
      BucketName: my-unique-bucket-name
```
