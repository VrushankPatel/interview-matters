# Overview

Java Fundamentals encompass the basic building blocks of the Java programming language, including syntax, data types, operators, control structures, and introductory object-oriented concepts.

# Detailed Explanation

## Data Types

Java supports primitive types (int, double, boolean, char, etc.) and reference types (objects, arrays).

## Operators

Arithmetic, relational, logical, assignment, and bitwise operators.

## Control Flow

Conditional statements (if-else, switch) and loops (for, while, do-while).

## Classes and Objects

Basic class definition, instantiation, and method invocation.

# Real-world Examples & Use Cases

- Developing console-based applications like calculators or simple games.
- Backend services for web applications.

# Code Examples

```java
public class Calculator {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int a = 5, b = 3;
        System.out.println("Sum: " + (a + b));
    }
}
```
