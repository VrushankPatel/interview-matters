# Overview

Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems (now Oracle). It's designed to be platform-independent, secure, and robust. Key fundamentals include data types, variables, operators, control structures, and basic syntax.

# Detailed Explanation

## Data Types

Java has two categories of data types: primitive and reference.

Primitive types: byte, short, int, long, float, double, char, boolean.

Reference types: classes, interfaces, arrays.

## Variables

Variables are containers for storing data values. They must be declared with a data type.

Example:

int age = 25;

String name = "John";

## Operators

Arithmetic: +, -, *, /, %

Relational: ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=

Logical: &&, ||, !

## Control Structures

If-else, switch, loops (for, while, do-while).

# Real-world Examples & Use Cases

- Building web applications with Spring Framework.
- Android app development.
- Enterprise software with Java EE.

# Code Examples

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

```java
// Variables and operators
int a = 10;
int b = 20;
int sum = a + b;
System.out.println("Sum: " + sum);
```
