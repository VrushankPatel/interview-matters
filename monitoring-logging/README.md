# Monitoring and Logging

## Overview

Monitoring and logging are critical components of system observability, enabling teams to track performance, diagnose issues, and maintain reliability in software systems. Monitoring focuses on real-time metrics and alerts, while logging provides historical records of events and errors.

## Detailed Explanation

### Monitoring

Monitoring involves collecting, analyzing, and visualizing key performance indicators (KPIs) such as CPU usage, memory consumption, network traffic, response times, and error rates. It helps in proactive issue detection and capacity planning.

Key components:
- **Metrics Collection**: Tools like Prometheus scrape metrics from applications.
- **Alerting**: Systems like Alertmanager notify teams of anomalies.
- **Visualization**: Dashboards in Grafana display trends and anomalies.

### Logging

Logging captures discrete events, messages, and errors generated by applications. Logs are categorized by severity levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR) and can be structured (e.g., JSON) for better searchability.

Best practices:
- Use structured logging for consistency.
- Centralize logs using aggregators like ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana).
- Implement log rotation to manage storage.

```

## Real-world Examples & Use Cases

- **E-commerce Platform**: Monitor transaction throughput and latency; log failed payments for fraud detection.
- **Microservices Architecture**: Centralized logging across services to trace distributed requests and identify bottlenecks.
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: Use monitoring to auto-scale resources based on load metrics.

## Code Examples

### Java Logging with SLF4J

```java
import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;

public class PaymentService {
    private static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(PaymentService.class);

    public void processPayment(PaymentRequest request) {
        logger.info("Processing payment for user: {}", request.getUserId());
        try {
            // Payment logic
            logger.debug("Payment processed successfully");
        } catch (Exception e) {
            logger.error("Payment failed for user: {}", request.getUserId(), e);
        }
    }
}
```

### Monitoring with Micrometer (Spring Boot)

```java
import io.micrometer.core.instrument.MeterRegistry;
import io.micrometer.core.instrument.Counter;
import io.micrometer.core.instrument.Timer;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

@Service
public class OrderService {
    private final Counter orderCounter;
    private final Timer orderTimer;

    public OrderService(MeterRegistry registry) {
        this.orderCounter = registry.counter("orders.total");
        this.orderTimer = registry.timer("orders.processing.time");
    }

    public void createOrder(Order order) {
        orderTimer.record(() -> {
            // Order creation logic
            orderCounter.increment();
        });
    }
}
```
