# Technical Interview Formats

## Overview

Technical interviews assess candidates' technical skills, problem-solving abilities, and domain knowledge through various structured formats. Understanding different interview types helps candidates prepare effectively and perform optimally.

## Detailed Explanation

Technical interviews typically progress through multiple rounds, each focusing on different aspects of a candidate's abilities. Common formats include:

### 1. Phone Screen
- Initial screening call (30-60 minutes)
- Basic technical questions and behavioral assessment
- Focus on fundamentals and communication skills

### 2. Coding Interviews
- Live coding on platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank
- Algorithm and data structure problems
- Time complexity analysis
- Code readability and efficiency

### 3. System Design Interviews
- High-level architecture design
- Scalability, reliability, and performance considerations
- Trade-off analysis
- Real-world system examples

### 4. Take-Home Assignments
- Extended coding projects
- Full-stack development tasks
- Code review and documentation requirements

### 5. Pair Programming Sessions
- Collaborative coding with interviewer
- Real-time problem-solving
- Communication and teamwork assessment

### 6. Whiteboard Interviews
- Manual problem-solving on whiteboard
- Algorithm explanation and optimization
- Step-by-step thinking process

## Real-world Examples & Use Cases

### FAANG Companies
Google's interview process includes phone screens, coding interviews, and system design rounds, each testing different technical competencies.

### Startup Interviews
Smaller companies might focus on pair programming sessions to assess cultural fit and collaborative coding skills.

### Specialized Roles
Data scientists face interviews with statistical problem-solving and machine learning implementation tasks.

## Code Examples

Example of a common coding interview problem (Two Sum):

```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    """
    Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, 
    return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
    """
    num_map = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in num_map:
            return [num_map[complement], i]
        num_map[num] = i
    return []

# Test case
nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]
target = 9
print(two_sum(nums, target))  # Output: [0, 1]
```
