# CI/CD Pipelines

## Overview

Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) are methodologies that automate the software development lifecycle from code integration to production deployment. CI ensures frequent code merges and automated testing, while CD automates the release process, enabling faster and more reliable software delivery.

## Detailed Explanation

### Key Concepts

- **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Developers integrate code changes into a shared repository multiple times a day. Each integration triggers automated builds and tests to detect issues early.
- **Continuous Deployment (CD)**: Extends CI by automatically deploying validated code to production environments, minimizing manual steps.
- **Continuous Delivery**: A variant of CD where deployments require manual approval.

### Pipeline Components

A typical CI/CD pipeline includes:

1. **Source Control**: Version control systems like Git.
2. **Build**: Compile code, resolve dependencies.
3. **Test**: Unit tests, integration tests, security scans.
4. **Deploy**: Push to staging/production.
5. **Monitor**: Log aggregation, performance monitoring.

### Tools and Technologies

- **Jenkins**: Open-source automation server.
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD integrated with GitHub.
- **GitLab CI/CD**: Built-in for GitLab.
- **CircleCI, Travis CI**: Cloud-based solutions.

### Benefits

- Faster release cycles.
- Improved code quality.
- Reduced deployment risks.

## Real-world Examples & Use Cases

- **E-commerce Platforms**: Automate updates for high-traffic sites like Amazon, ensuring zero-downtime deployments.
- **Mobile App Development**: Build, test, and release apps to app stores automatically.
- **Microservices Deployment**: Independently deploy services in a distributed architecture.

## Code Examples

### GitHub Actions Pipeline for Java Application

```yaml
name: Java CI/CD

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build-and-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Set up JDK 17
      uses: actions/setup-java@v3
      with:
        java-version: '17'
        distribution: 'temurin'
    - name: Cache Maven packages
      uses: actions/cache@v3
      with:
        path: ~/.m2
        key: ${{ runner.os }}-m2-${{ hashFiles('**/pom.xml') }}
        restore-keys: ${{ runner.os }}-m2
    - name: Build with Maven
      run: mvn clean compile
    - name: Run tests
      run: mvn test
    - name: Package
      run: mvn package -DskipTests
    - name: Deploy to staging
      if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
      run: echo "Deploy to staging environment"
```

### Jenkins Pipeline Script

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn clean package'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn test'
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                sh 'scp target/app.jar server:/opt/app/'
                sh 'ssh server systemctl restart app'
            }
        }
    }
}
```
