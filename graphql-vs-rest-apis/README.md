# GraphQL vs REST APIs

## Overview

GraphQL and REST are two popular approaches for designing APIs. REST (Representational State Transfer) is a traditional architectural style for web services, while GraphQL is a query language and runtime for APIs that allows clients to request exactly the data they need.

## Detailed Explanation

### REST APIs

REST APIs are based on HTTP methods and resource-based URLs. They follow principles like statelessness, cacheability, and a uniform interface.

- **Key Characteristics**:
  - Uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
  - Resources are identified by URLs
  - Responses are typically in JSON or XML format
  - Over-fetching or under-fetching of data is common

### GraphQL APIs

GraphQL is a query language for APIs that provides a more efficient and flexible way to fetch data.

- **Key Characteristics**:
  - Single endpoint for all queries
  - Clients specify exactly what data they need
  - Strongly typed schema
  - Real-time capabilities with subscriptions

### Key Differences

| Aspect | REST | GraphQL |
|--------|------|---------|
| Data Fetching | Multiple endpoints, potential over/under-fetching | Single query, exact data specification |
| Versioning | URL versioning or headers | Schema evolution |
| Real-time | Polling or WebSockets | Built-in subscriptions |
| Caching | HTTP caching | Application-level caching |

## Real-world Examples & Use Cases

### When to Use REST

- Simple CRUD operations
- Public APIs with stable requirements
- When clients need full resource representations
- Legacy systems integration

### When to Use GraphQL

- Complex data requirements with multiple related entities
- Mobile applications with limited bandwidth
- Rapidly evolving frontend requirements
- Real-time data updates

Example: A social media app using GraphQL to fetch user posts with comments and likes in a single query, vs multiple REST calls.

## Code Examples

### REST API Example

```javascript
// GET /api/users/1/posts
fetch('/api/users/1/posts')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(posts => console.log(posts));

// GET /api/posts/1/comments
fetch('/api/posts/1/comments')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(comments => console.log(comments));
```

### GraphQL API Example

```javascript
const query = `
  query GetUserPosts($userId: ID!) {
    user(id: $userId) {
      posts {
        id
        title
        comments {
          id
          text
          author {
            name
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
`;

fetch('/graphql', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({ query, variables: { userId: 1 } })
})
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data));
```
