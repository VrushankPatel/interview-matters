# Overview

Async logging improves application performance by offloading log writing to background threads, preventing blocking of main application flow.

# Detailed Explanation

In synchronous logging, the application thread waits for the log to be written to disk or sent over network. Async logging uses a queue and a separate thread to handle logging asynchronously.

## Benefits

- Reduced latency for application threads
- Better throughput under high load

# Real-world Examples & Use Cases

- High-throughput web servers where logging must not slow down request processing
- Applications with frequent logging in performance-critical paths

# Code Examples

```xml
<!-- Logback configuration for async appender -->
<appender name="ASYNC" class="ch.qos.logback.classic.AsyncAppender">
    <appender-ref ref="FILE" />
    <queueSize>512</queueSize>
    <discardingThreshold>20</discardingThreshold>
</appender>
```

```java
// Using async logging in code
import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;

public class AsyncLoggerExample {
    private static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(AsyncLoggerExample.class);

    public void processRequest() {
        logger.info("Processing request asynchronously");
        // Main logic here
    }
}
```
