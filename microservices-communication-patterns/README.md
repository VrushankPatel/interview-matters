# Microservices Communication Patterns

## Overview

In microservices architecture, services need to communicate efficiently and reliably. Communication patterns define how services interact, balancing factors like coupling, performance, and fault tolerance. Common patterns include synchronous calls for immediate responses and asynchronous messaging for decoupling.

## Detailed Explanation

### Synchronous Communication
- **REST/HTTP**: Services call each other via HTTP APIs. Simple but can lead to tight coupling.
- **gRPC**: Uses Protocol Buffers for efficient, typed communication over HTTP/2.
- **GraphQL**: Allows clients to request exactly the data they need, reducing over-fetching.

### Asynchronous Communication
- **Message Queues**: Services send messages to queues (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka) for decoupling.
- **Event-Driven**: Publish events that other services subscribe to.
- **Request-Reply over Queues**: Asynchronous with response channels.

### Cross-Cutting Patterns
- **API Gateway**: Single entry point for clients, routing to appropriate services.
- **Service Mesh**: Manages service-to-service communication, providing features like load balancing, security.
- **Circuit Breaker**: Prevents cascading failures by stopping calls to failing services.

### Data Formats
- JSON for REST.
- Protocol Buffers or Avro for efficiency.

## Real-world Examples & Use Cases

- **E-commerce Checkout**: Synchronous call to Payment Service, asynchronous event for Order Confirmation.
- **User Notifications**: Event-driven system where User Service publishes events consumed by Email Service.
- **API Composition**: Gateway aggregates data from multiple services for a unified response.

## Code Examples

### REST Client in Java (using Spring WebClient)
```java
import org.springframework.web.reactive.function.client.WebClient;

WebClient client = WebClient.create();
Mono<String> response = client.get()
    .uri("http://user-service/users/1")
    .retrieve()
    .bodyToMono(String.class);
```

### gRPC Service Definition (Proto)
```proto
service UserService {
  rpc GetUser (UserRequest) returns (UserResponse);
}

message UserRequest {
  string id = 1;
}

message UserResponse {
  string name = 1;
  string email = 2;
}
```

### Kafka Producer in Java
```java
import org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.KafkaProducer;
import org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.ProducerRecord;

Properties props = new Properties();
props.put("bootstrap.servers", "localhost:9092");
props.put("key.serializer", "org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer");
props.put("value.serializer", "org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer");

KafkaProducer<String, String> producer = new KafkaProducer<>(props);
producer.send(new ProducerRecord<>("orders", "order123", "Order placed"));
producer.close();
```

## Common Pitfalls & Edge Cases

- Synchronous calls can cause latency bottlenecks.
- Asynchronous systems may have eventual consistency issues.
- Handling partial failures in distributed calls.
